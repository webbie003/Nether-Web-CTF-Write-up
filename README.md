# Nether Web - Browser-Based CTF Write-Up

## Overview
While preparing for the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) exam, I discovered the Nether Web CTF hosted at parath.net, which was mentioned on Reddit’s r/securityCTF community. This browser-based CTF consists of eight progressive web challenges, referred to as "Missions," designed to test a variety of web security concepts such as input validation, authentication bypass, insecure client-side controls, and session management vulnerabilities. I challenged myself to complete all eight tasks, applying techniques learned while studying for CEH and using the opportunity to reinforce my practical skills through hands-on experience.

**Difficulty:** Easy – Medium

## Challenge Description
Challenge Series: Nether Web
Format: Browser-based, progressive web application vulnerabilities
Objective: Exploit various weaknesses in the target web application to progress through each challenge and ultimately capture all flags.

Nether Web challenges participants with missions across reconnaissance, analysis, cryptography, web vulnerabilities, and exploitation — each crafted to simulate real-world attack scenarios and test practical cybersecurity skills.
